"This book is about the summer I spent seeing North America, meeting
North Americans, and trying to figure out how people live," writes
Greenspun after losing his companion.  You'll come face to face with
examples of the stunning ethnic, scenic, and cultural richness of the
continent.
<p>
Meet both sides of the language war in Montreal, bored youths in the
Midwest, North Dakota Harley riders, struggling single mothers in the
Yukon, and free spirits in Alaska.  Join Greenspun as he travels up
the spine of the Rocky Mountains into Canada and then up the Alaska
Highway.  Splash down in a float plane and spend a week with 20 bears.
<p>
Work your way through the Inside Passage on the Alaska Marine Highway,
and get inside a salmon processing factory.  See if Greenspun survives
touring Vancouver, Vancouver Island, and the Pacific Northwest with old
friends and new.  Ask about polygamy in Salt Lake City, mountain bike
the Slickrock Trail, and learn how to live with AIDS in Utah.  Watch
the waters recede from the Great Flood of '93 in St. Louis.

Follow Greenspun back to Boston and MIT.
